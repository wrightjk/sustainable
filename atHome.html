			<h4>1</h4>
			<h3>Hang dry clothes rather than machine dry</h3>
			<p>If you must machine dry, make sure you dry in full loads (without overfilling) and swap dryer sheets for reusable dryer balls.</p>

			<h4>2</h4>
			<h3>Don’t use trash bags for trash bins</h3>
			<p>Plastic trash bags take 10-20 years to decompose. Trash bags have even been found in the Marianas Trench. Instead, periodically wash your trash bins.</p>

			<h4>3</h4>
			<h3>Wash clothes in cold water</h3>
			<p>It takes less energy to wash clothes in cold water since the machine doesn’t have to heat the water and wash clothes. Also, the enzymes in laundry detergents work better against most stains in cold water.</p>

			<h4>4</h4>
			<h3>Plant your own vegetable gardens</h3>
			<p>Planting your own vegetables is good for your health and the environment, as you are deciding what is going into your plants, soil, and body. Skip on the harmful chemicals and pesticides and reduce the amount running off into our soil and waterways.</p>

			<h4>5</h4>
			<h3>Upcycle furniture</h3>
			<p>Finding good quality, affordable furniture is a difficult task, and difficult for companies as well. Buy used furniture and ucycle it to keep furniture out of landfills.</p>

			<h4>6</h4>
			<h3>Watch water usage</h3>
			<p>Turn off water while brushing your teeth and switch out shower heads and toilets for alternative water-conserving versions.</p>

			<h4>7</h4>
			<h3>Create your own all-purpose cleaner</h3>
			<p>Manufactured cleaners are often chock full of toxins harmful for the environment. Instead, create your own all-purpose cleanser by mixing equal parts vinegar and water with a half part of baking soda.</p>

			<h4>8</h4>
			<h3>Use washable cloths over paper products</h3>
			<p>Reduce your paper waste by opting for washable cloths instead. Keep paper products out of sight to avoid using them so often.</p>

			<h4>9</h4>
			<h3>Renovate an old home rather than build a new one</h3>
			<p>The construction and demolition of homes each year creates 136 million tons of waste on average.</p>

			<h4>10</h4>
			<h3>Watch your energy usage</h3>
			<p>Unplug electronics when not in use, turn lights off at night, stream movies on a TV rather than a gaming console, use a laptop over a computer. All of these things can help lessen the amount of energy you use each day.</p>
