			<h4>1</h4>
			<h3>Clean your waterways</h3>
			<p>Look out for your community members by correctly disposing of the waste that gets washed downstream, and get together with your community my planning a community cleanup.</p>

			<h4>2</h4>
			<h3>Start a community garden</h3>
			<p>Avoid pumping toxins into the soil and into your vegetables by growing your own. Growing food locally also cuts down on travel costs and gas emissions. Make it a collaborative effort to grow cooperation, friendship, and understanding among your community.</p>

			<h4>3</h4>
			<h3>Advocate for bike-friendly communities and businesses</h3>
			<p>Bike-friendly areas and bike lanes can help cut down on gas emissions and travel costs. Not to mention it’s good exercise!</p>

			<h4>4</h4>
			<h3>Volunteer</h3>
			<p>Volunteering your time and energy for your community is an investment for your community.</p>

			<h4>5</h4>
			<h3>Organize car-free days</h3>
			<p>Like creating bike-friendly communities, this can help cut down on gas emissions and travel costs. It’s also a good way to promote alternative forms of transportation.</p>

			<h4>6</h4>
			<h3>Use reusable grocery bags</h3>
			<p>Bring your own grocery bags when grocery shopping. Some stores require you to pay for their plastic and paper bags, and other stores will give you discounts on your groceries if you bring your own bags.</p>

			<h4>7</h4>
			<h3>Purchase fair trade products</h3>
			<p>Products with the fair trade label come from farms that provide fair wages and safe labor. Support these practices while refusing to fund unsafe and unfair working environments.</p>

			<h4>8</h4>
			<h3>Exchange goods with neighbors</h3>
			<p>Avoid having your unused items end up in landfills by offering it up to your community. There are plenty of online spaces for this purpose, such as craigslist, ebay, and facebook marketplace.</p>

			<h4>9</h4>
			<h3>Compost</h3>
			<p>30% of what we throw in the trash is food scraps and yard waste. By composting, this can be turned into nutrient-rich soil for a home or community garden. Some communities have composting companies that will come around and collect and distribute your compost for you if you have no use for it, such as Soil Cycles in Harrisonburg, VA.</p>

			<h4>10</h4>
			<h3>Shop locally</h3>
			<p>The energy and costs that go into commercial good production and transportation are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. Buying local connects you with your community members while helping reduce these pollutants.</p>
