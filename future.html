			<h4>1</h4>
			<h3>Shop smart</h3>
			<p>Pay attention to the companies who are making environmentally friendly choices and those are contributing to the decay of our natural environments. Since 1988, just 100 companies have contributed to over 70% of the total global industrial greenhouse emissions. Are you supporting these companies?</p>

			<h4>2</h4>
			<h3>Vote</h3>
			<p>Elect candidates with good climate action plans. 69% of voters believe the United States should take aggressive actions towards combating climate change, but how are we going to do that?</p>

			<h4>3</h4>
			<h3>Educate</h3>
			<p>Have conversations with friends, family members, community members about climate change and why and how we should live more sustainably. The more people that choose to live sustainably, the more we reduce our environmental pollutants.</p>

			<h4>4</h4>
			<h3>Invest in sustainable companies</h3>
			<p>Show you support for environmentally conscious companies with your money. Additionally, electric vehicle stocks are considered a growth market today as investors anticipate future profitability as the auto transmission market turns away from fossil fuels.</p>

			<h4>5</h4>
			<h3>Disinvest from fossil fuels</h3>
			<p>On the opposite side of the earlier tip, don’t monetarily fund companies directly contributing to environmental pollutants.</p>

			<h4>6</h4>
			<h3>Educate younger generations</h3>
			<p>Because a main goal of sustainability is for nature and humans to coexist for generations to come, it’s only right that the younger generations are aware of how to care for nature as well. The National Park Service has multiple programs for younger kids to learn about our national parks and how to protect them.</p>

			<h4>7</h4>
			<h3>Reform school lunches</h3>
			<p>School lunches are a large contributor to wastes in America due to the single-use plastic trays used in many school districts. In many districts, school lunches also aren’t the most nutritious. Groups like the Urban School Food Alliance are working to reform school lunches in America.</p>

			<h4>8</h4>
			<h3>Have your voice heard</h3>
			<p>Whether through town hall meetings, marches, protests, or other events, there are many ways to let your community and your representative officials know you want to make combating climate change a priority.</p>

			<h4>9</h4>
			<h3>Focus on your immediate environment</h3>
			<p>Sustainable actions may affect different communities differently. Pay attention to your immediate environment, the species within it, and what is affecting your environment and how you can help it. It’s okay to start in your town or city, you don’t have to tackle the whole world’s issues all at once.</p>

			<h4>10</h4>
			<h3>Start sustainable practices today</h3>
			<p>Each time you choose a more sustainable action or choice, you are helping to better the future of our environment, of the creatures we coexist with, of ourselves, and of generations to come.</p>
