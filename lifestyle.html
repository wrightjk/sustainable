			<h4>1</h4>
			<h3>Walk more</h3>
			<p>Cut down on gas emissions by choosing to walk when able, or even just as a way to spend time. Studies show that those who walk more may live longer and have lower rates of depression.</p>

			<h4>2</h4>
			<h3>Don’t follow the trends</h3>
			<p>Buying more and trying to keep up with trends isn’t only bad for your wallet, but also for the supply chains that produce goods and the landfills these goods inevitably end up in.</p>

			<h4>3</h4>
			<h3>Stop drinking bottled water</h3>
			<p>Reduce your single-use plastic usage by drinking tap water from cups and reusable water bottles. There’s always water filters if needed!</p>

			<h4>4</h4>
			<h3>Cook at home</h3>
			<p>Home-cooked food is healthier and cheaper than eating out, and growing food takes less than half the energy as processing, packaging, and transporting food to restaurants.</p>

			<h4>5</h4>
			<h3>Avoid buying packaged items</h3>
			<p>About a quarter of all plastic waste is a result of packaging. Some communities even have package-free grocery stores, such as the Friendly City Food Co-op in Harrisonburg, VA.</p>

			<h4>6</h4>
			<h3>Recycle</h3>
			<p>An obvious sustainability practice, but still an important one. In addition to curbing the pollution in landfills, it also helps save natural resources by reducing the need for raw materials.</p>

			<h4>7</h4>
			<h3>Try carpooling</h3>
			<p>Use rideshare apps such as Uber or Lyft, or if meeting with friends, suggest everyone ride together instead of driving separate.</p>

			<h4>8</h4>
			<h3>Opt out of a physical receipt</h3>
			<p>When possible, turn down the printer receipt. 250 million gallons of oil, 10 million trees, and one billion gallons of water are used each year for the creation of receipts.</p>

			<h4>9</h4>
			<h3>Skip straws</h3>
			<p>About 500 million straws are used in the United States each day, most of which end up in the ocean and harming marine life. Invest in a reusable straw and help reduce the amount of pollution in our oceans.</p>

			<h4>10</h4>
			<h3>Thriftshop</h3>
			<p>Buying second hand clothing helps keep plastic out of landfills and oceans and decreases worldwide textile demand and waste. Plus, you end up with some super cool wardrobe pieces that others won’t have.</p>
