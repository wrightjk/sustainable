				By definition, sustainability is ‘the ability to exist constantly’. The goal of living sustainably is to adhere to that definition, not only for your own needs as a human being but for the needs of the environment and for future generations. As a living being on Earth, everything needed for our survival and well-being comes either directly or indirectly from nature. Sustainability involves pursuing the conditions needed for humans and nature to live in harmony together for the continued survival and well-being of nature, the present generation, and future generations to come. Sustainability functions off of the presumption that resources are finite, and that they should be used mindfully with a focus on the long term results and consequences that using these resources entails.

				Living in a way that is sustainable for both the Earth and its human inhabitants is so important that in 1970, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) was signed into law, which requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of their proposed plans before making any decisions. The NEPA declared it a national policy “to create and maintain conditions under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit fulfilling the social, economic and other requirements of present and future generations.”

				The events of the year 2020 are a good example of what can happen if we do not develop sustainably. Pandemics, natural disasters, climate change, deforestation are just some examples of the hazards we can face if sustainable development is not achieved.
			</p>
			<p>
				Fortunately, living sustainably for the individual doesn’t have to be so hard. Through small daily changes and practices, each individual person can make a small contribution to sustainable development for the benefit of themselves, the Earth, and future generations. The obstacles ahead seem daunting, but the battle strategies to face them can be simpler than they seem.
